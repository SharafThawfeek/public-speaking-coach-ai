“Good morning, everyone. It is a true honor to stand before you today, fulfilling a dream I’ve carried since my childhood. I want to talk with you about a subject that touches every part of our lives: technology. Technology is often described as both a blessing and a curse. Some people see it as a force that disrupts and even destroys, while others believe it saves lives and opens doors to unimaginable opportunities. The truth, as I see it, lies somewhere in between.

Technology surrounds us. It’s in our homes, on our phones, in our classrooms, and across every industry. Yet many people still struggle to keep up with its pace. I think of my grandmother, who finds it overwhelming to even turn on a computer. For her, and for many older generations, technology can feel intimidating. This gap reminds us that innovation, while powerful, must also be inclusive.

At the same time, we cannot ignore the ways technology can make us complacent. We walk less because we drive more. Children once played outside with friends; now they spend hours on screens, endlessly scrolling. If left unchecked, this reliance can weaken not only our bodies but also our sense of community.

But let’s not forget the other side of the story. Technology has saved countless lives. Medical breakthroughs happen faster than ever before, hospitals are equipped with advanced tools, and education is no longer limited to the classroom — knowledge is now accessible to anyone, anywhere. These are remarkable achievements that we must celebrate.

So where does that leave us? Technology is not simply good or bad. It is a tool, and like any tool, its value depends on how we use it. We must embrace it with wisdom, ensuring that it enhances rather than diminishes our humanity. Used thoughtfully, technology can help us build healthier societies, stronger connections, and brighter futures.

Thank you for your attention, and I hope today you leave with one simple message: technology is powerful, but it is up to us to guide that power responsibly.”
