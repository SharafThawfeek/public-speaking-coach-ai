“Uh, hello, good morning peoples, I am very, very prouds to be standing up here on this stage today because, you know, it’s my dream since childhoods. I wanna talk about, um, technology and how it is, like, destroying or maybe saving lifes, depends, but anyway it’s very important and we should, like, focus on it more and more and more.

So technology is, like, everywhere, in our homes, our phone, our tables, in the schools, and many peoples don’t understand it wellly. For example, my grandma she don’t know how to open the computer, and that is why technology is bad sometimes because old peoples cannot using it and they just feels frustrate.

Another thing, is that, uh, technology makes peoples lazy. Like, before peoples walking, now they is sitting on cars all day. Before children playing outsides with balls, now they just sitting on the phones, scrolling and scrolling, no life, no future, just phones. And that is a big problem which, you know, we must solving it together, if we wants the society be better.

On the other hand, technology also making many good things, like medicines is developing faster, hospitals is more equipments, and education is also, like, online and everything. So, in conclusion, my final point is that technology is bad and good but mostly good, or maybe mostly bad, I don’t knows exactly, but I think we should using technology carefully and never abuse it, 

otherwise society is collapse. Thank you for listening me and I hope you all, like, learned a lots from my speech, even if it not so perfect. Thank you very much peoples.”
